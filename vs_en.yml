What is the difference between a law, a principle, and a theory?: |
    I have read some nice definitions in other answers. I assume you are asking about physical (scientific) jargon rather than political or legal, though.

    Words are just tools. Use them how you wish, but…

    In science we use the word law to mean some observed phenomenon that can be always relied on. Something that happens the same way, every time, without fail. The law of gravity says that there is an attractive force between two massive objects. That is so, every time we check. It doesn’t explain why. A law is not a proof, or an explanation, just a statement of a repeatable observation that can be measured and used as a firm basis for research.

    A principle is a fundamental mechanism by which some phenomenon is observed to operate. Evolution operates on two main principles: genetic diversity and natural selection. Animal energy production operates on the principle of oxidation of glucose. A car engine operates on the principle of internal combustion. A principle is again not a proof or an explanation - it’s just the straight-out description of a process.

    A theory is more interesting. A theory is an attempt at an explanation, arrived at after exhaustive research and investigation, including critically examining all the laws and principles involved in a process. It is not a tentative guess: that’s a hypothesis. The theory (as opposed to the law) of gravity is an explanation of how and why objects attract. A theory is a fully formed account of how we believe something happens. A theory is neither a law nor a proof, and it might even be wrong, but it is much more than just an idea.
